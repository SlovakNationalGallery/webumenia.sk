/*
This file generates the tailwind-preflight-scoped.css file -- Tailwind base styles,
limited to our .tailwind-rules scope.

More about Preflight: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight

This LESS file and the CSS can be removed (and replaced) by enabling standard
Preflight (in tailwind.config.js), once we get rid of Bootstrap.
