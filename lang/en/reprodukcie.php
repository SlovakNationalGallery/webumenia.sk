                              <li>We do not print reproductions in their <strong>"true" size</strong> to avoid mistaking the reproduction for its original artwork. We keep the original format ratio, colors, and signature. The maximum size of the reproduction is twice the size of the original artwork.</li>
                              <li>The <strong>type of paper, ink and the color of passe-partout are chosen by specialists at the Slovak National Gallery</strong>, according to the technique and material of the artwork.</li>
                              <li>Printed reproductions can only be used for <strong>private purposes</strong>. If you would like to use prints for other purposes, such as exhibition or a commercial use (e.g. decoration of a restaurant), the order will be processed like a digital reproduction (see below). The use of printed reproduction for a commercial purpose without a previous consultation with the Slovak National Gallery may result in <strong>breaking of copyright laws</strong>.</li>
                              <li>SNG cannot process all orders of printed reproductions for <strong>commercial purposes</strong>. When processing a particular order, we are, among other things, looking at the way the cultural heritage is treated, or how it responds to the local context or region.</li>
